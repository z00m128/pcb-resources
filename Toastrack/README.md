# ZX Spectrum 128k issue 6U replica _(WORK IN PROGRESS)_
Three people have contacted me independently asking for a fix for a broken Toastrack from eBay, and it was always a scam. All three were destroyed computers from fraudulent dealers, with a destroyed or scrapped board hidden in a relatively nice box. That's why I decided to draw a replica of the board. I used the wreckages and a relatively good scan of an unassembled issue 6U board as a source.

The redraw is complete, but I'm leaving some time for it to be checked again and the first verification board to be made. I don't know when yet, but it's planned as soon as possible.

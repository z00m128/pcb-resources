# ZX Spectrum 128k issue 6U replica
Some people have contacted me independently asking for a fix for a broken Toastrack from eBay, and it was always a scam. All were destroyed computers from fraudulent dealers, with a destroyed or scrapped board hidden in a relatively nice box. That's why I decided to draw a replica of the board. I used the wreckages and a relatively good scan of an unassembled issue 6U board as a source. The board is drawn in Sprint-Layout 6.0, you can download the viewer [here](https://www.abacom-online.de/updates/Sprint-Layout60_Viewer.exe).

The first prototype is working, PCB has only cosmetic flaws. [Here](https://github.com/z00m128/pcb-resources/blob/main/Toastrack/pics/README.md) are some pictures from building it.

The repository already contains a fixed version, but it has not yet been tested. However, it should work.

# Melodik2 rev 2.0

Melodik was AY interface for ZX Spectrum and compatibles, produced by Didaktik v.d. in 90's. This is my third attempt at making a replacement, as the original PCB was of terrible quality, was breaking down, and the main oscillator tended to start at all sorts of frequencies, just not the right one. The PCB is not verified yet, but it should work.

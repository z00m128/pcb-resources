# Melodik2 rev 1.1

Melodik was AY interface for ZX Spectrum and compatibles, produced by Didaktik v.d. in 90's. This was my second attempt at making a replacement, as the original PCB was of terrible quality, was breaking down, and the main oscillator tended to start at all sorts of frequencies, just not the right one. The PCB is verified and working.

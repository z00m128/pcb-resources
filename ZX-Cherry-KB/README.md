# ZX Cherry Keyboard

I needed a proper mechanical keyboard for one of my projects and none of the freely available solutions suited me. So I decided to design my own keyboard, but in a way that it would be usable elsewhere, not just in my project. This keyboard is compatible with the ZX Spectrum +2 (gray) and should work also with other ZX Spectrums and clones. With ZX Spectrum +2A/+3 it is not tested, but the base matrix is connected identical to other Spectrums, so it should work too.

Due to the hard-to-find 4.5u spacebar, the key layout has been changed to the easier-to-find 6.25u spacebar. I also swapped the BREAK and DELETE keys and moved EDIT and other keys to make it more comfortable for me.

With [these](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4978541) keycaps it fits nicely to +2 case, see the prototype photos below.

# ZX Cherry Keyboard _(Work In Progress)_

I needed a proper mechanical keyboard for one of my projects and none of the freely available solutions suited me. So I decided to design my own keyboard, but in a way that it would be usable elsewhere, not just in my project. If I measured correctly, this keyboard should be compatible with the ZX Spectrum +2 (gray) and should work also with other ZX Spectrums and clones, except ZX Spectrum +2A/+3 (different keyboard matrix). 

Due to the hard-to-find 4.5u spacebar, the key layout has been changed to the easier-to-find 6.25u spacebar. I also swapped the BREAK and DELETE keys and moved EDIT and other keys to make it more comfortable for me.

It is not finished or tested yet, but I plan to do so soon.

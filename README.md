# My PCB library 
Here is the set of printed circuit boards created by me over a time. I used mostly KiCad (PCBs created from scratch) or Sprint-Layout 6.0 (PCBs recreated from scans or photos).

## Didaktik M
A clone of the ZX Spectrum computer manufactured by the Slovak company Didaktik v.d. in the early 1990s. The recreated PCB has been verified and is functional.

## Didaktik Kompakt, version 2.3
A clone of the ZX Spectrum computer manufactured by the Slovak company Didaktik v.d. in the early 1990s. This clone is actually a Didaktik M with a built-in D80 disk system running the MDOS operating system. The recreated PCB has been verified and is functional.

## Lamac CPM
A board used to modify a ZX Spectrum computer to expand memory (80k-256k) for use with CP/M. It was common modification in former Czechoslovakia, well documented in local electronics magazine. This PCB was not vertified yet.

## PMD ColorAce
Hardware modification for PMD85 computer. It extends its capabilities and allows to display 7 different colors on the black background. This is my own iteration of PCB. It was not verified yet.

## PMD KeyFace
PS/2 keyboard interface for PMD85 computer. This is my own iteration of PCB. It was not verified yet.

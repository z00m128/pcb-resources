# Personal PCB library 
Here is the set of printed circuit boards created by me over a time. I used mostly KiCad (PCBs created from scratch) or Sprint-Layout 6.0 (PCBs recreated from scans or photos).

## Didaktik M
A clone of the ZX Spectrum computer manufactured by the Slovak company Didaktik v.d. in the early 1990s. The recreated PCB has been verified and is functional.

## Didaktik Kompakt, version 2.3
A clone of the ZX Spectrum computer manufactured by the Slovak company Didaktik v.d. in the early 1990s. This clone is actually a Didaktik M with a built-in D80 disk system running the MDOS operating system. The recreated PCB has been verified and is functional.

## Lamac CPM
A board used to modify a ZX Spectrum computer to expand memory (80k-256k) for use with CP/M. It was common modification in former Czechoslovakia, well documented in local electronics magazine. This circuit board was not vertified yet.

The materials are freely available. The production of these printed circuit boards for profit is strictly prohibited. See license.

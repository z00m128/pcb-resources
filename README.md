# My PCB library 
Here is the set of printed circuit boards created by me over a time. I used mostly KiCad (PCBs created from scratch) or Sprint-Layout 6.0 (PCBs recreated from scans or photos).

## [Didaktik M'92](https://github.com/z00m128/pcb-resources/tree/main/Didaktik-M-92)
A clone of the ZX Spectrum computer manufactured by the Slovak company Didaktik v.d. in the early 1990s. The recreated PCB has been verified and is functional.

## [Didaktik Kompakt, revision 2.3](https://github.com/z00m128/pcb-resources/tree/main/Didaktik-Kompakt-ver23)
A clone of the ZX Spectrum computer manufactured by the Slovak company Didaktik v.d. in the early 1990s. This clone is actually a Didaktik M with a built-in D80 disk system running the MDOS operating system. The recreated PCB has been verified and is functional.

## Melodik 2, revisions [1.0](https://github.com/z00m128/pcb-resources/tree/main/Melodik2/v1.0), [1.1](https://github.com/z00m128/pcb-resources/tree/main/Melodik2/v1.1) and [2.0](https://github.com/z00m128/pcb-resources/tree/main/Melodik2/v2.0)
Melodik was an audio interface for the ZX Spectrum and compatibles, manufactured by Didaktik v.d. during the 1990s. It was of poor quality, suffered from several ailments and broke down. These were my 3 attempts to recreate it so that the result fit into the original box. The revisions differ only minimally and are a consequence of KiCad not being able to properly open projects created in its older versions. All have a fixed oscillator error, removed collision with D40 / D80 / Kompakt floppy controllers. The latest revision 2.0 is not tested but should be functional. It has an added filter in the LM386 power supply.

## KeyFace
A PS/2 keyboard interface for ZX Spectrum, [internal](https://github.com/z00m128/pcb-resources/tree/main/KeyFace) and [external](https://github.com/z00m128/pcb-resources/tree/main/KeyFace-external) versions. Both were developed by MDV in late 90's for Kompakt Servis company. Both PCBs are verified and working.

## [Lamac CPM](https://github.com/z00m128/pcb-resources/tree/main/Lamac-CPM)
A board used to modify a ZX Spectrum computer to expand memory (80k-256k) for use with CP/M. It was common modification in former Czechoslovakia, well documented in local electronics magazine. This PCB was not vertified yet.

## [PMD ColorAce](https://github.com/z00m128/pcb-resources/tree/main/PMD-ColorAce)
Hardware modification for PMD85 computer. It extends its capabilities and allows to display 7 different colors on the black background. This is my own iteration of PCB. It was not verified yet.

## [PMD KeyFace](https://github.com/z00m128/pcb-resources/tree/main/PMD-KeyFace)
PS/2 keyboard interface for PMD85 computer. This is my own iteration of PCB. It was not verified yet.

## [Kicad libraries](https://github.com/z00m128/pcb-resources/tree/main/KiCad-libs)
Set of libraries for KiCad 6.0 and newer that you may need if you want to edit some of my projects.

_GAL20V8, GAL22V10, AY-3-8912, AY-3-8910, ZX Spectrum expansion connector._
